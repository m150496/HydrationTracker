# HydrationTracker
In this Agile Software Development (a course in ICE Master studies) project in SS 24, I was a member of the team of 7 developers in collaboration with one Product Owner, one Scrum Master and one DevOps Engineer. That was the first time I participated in the development of a  mobile app. Even though it was a group work, meaning I haven't done everything myself my experience and my experience hasn't allowed me to contribute from organizational and planning aspect, I am still proud about my overall contribution.

I've learned basics in Android Kotlin App development as well as the basic directory structure such as converters, dal/utils, enums, interfaces, models, testedLogic, ui/fragments, ui/theme, utils, viewModels, res/drawable, res/layout and values. I've understood Dao functions, the role of which is to process Room databases as well as creating classes for respective entites. Even though it was tough I started understanding a connection between fragments, viewModels and layouts and the main philosophy of MVVM architecture. This wouldn't have been possible without my developer colleagues (especially a Lead Developer), as a result, I've contributed in completing a Rehydrating ticket myslef, where I developed fragment_rehydration layout, getBloodAlcoholValueFromUser(userID: Int) and updateBloodAlcoholValue(userID: Int, bloodAlcoholValue: Double, bloodAlcoholLastUpdated: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(java.time.ZoneOffset.UTC)) in UserDao, added alcoholInGrams attribute in AlkIntake, necessary modifications in HomeActivity and HomeFragment, implemented complete RehydrationFragment, included necessary methods in HomeViewModel such as refreshTodaysIntake(), refreshTodaysWaterProgress(), getCurrentBloodAlcoholValue(), modified updateBloodAlcoholValueSinceHours(hours: Float), contributed in getDailyWaterGoal(). Other methods: calculateDehydrationPercentage, calculateTheoreticalTotalDehydration()
